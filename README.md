# How many calories are in your dish?


# Introduction

Welcome to my recipes and ratings analysis. This homework analyzes a **Recipe Dataset** that contains information regarding various recipes, their ingredients, ratings, and preparation times. Using certain features of recipes, we can predict the number of calories for a recipe. This question is valuable for chefs, food enthusiasts, and those interested in understanding nutritional aspects behind foods. This dataset contains 83782 rows and 3 rows relevant to my analysis. These rows include total fat (total fat in grams in a recipe), sugar (grams of sugar in a recipe), and minutes (number of minutes it takes for a recipe).
